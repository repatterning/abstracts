# Critical Preliminaries

## Problem Statement

The problem and why is it important to solve

> The ability to anticipate problems is critical to the effectiveness of weather resilience teams.  In the case of Scotland's resilience team, an item of interest is river levels because unusual levels, or unusual river-level-rates-of-change, hint at possible or impending bank breaches.  At present 
> 
> * During storms the team neither has access to real-time forecasts **nor** supplementary measures/metrics.
> * Outwith storms the team does not have access to river levels intelligence, such intelligence enables hydrologists to identify problems, study patterns, etc., in-time.

Hence, the need for a river intelligence hub that hosts (a) standard river-levels metrics, initially raw river level measures, daily extrema & medians, drift, and (b) river level forecasts and rates-of-change of river levels.

## Outcome Expectations, Underlying Aims

**The potential product's outcome expectations** &Rarr;

* Ahead-of, During storms:
    1. Forecasts w.r.t gauges that fall within a warning area.
    2. Continuous publications of rates-of-change of river levels; every 120 minutes

* Daily:
    1. Raw river levels
    2. Daily extrema & medians
    3. Drift
    4. Rates of change of river levels
    5. Annual river level pattern comparison per gauge
    6. A comparison of river level changes w.r.t gauges within the same catchment. 


**Underlying aims** &Rarr;

* During storms:
    1. Point forecasts errors within $\pm 0.025%$ 

<br>
<br>

## Deployment Goal

A continuously & automatically updated online intelligence hub that hosts river level intelligence metrics and forecasts.
